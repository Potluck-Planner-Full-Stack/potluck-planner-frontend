If you have ever tried to organize a potluck through text messages, online to-do lists or spreadsheets, you'll understand why this app is essential. 

In the world of social gatherings and potlucks the "Potluck Planner" is king. This is your place for all things pot luck.

2. As an `organizer` you can adjust `date`s, `time`s and `location`s of the potluck

3. As an `organizer` you can use the list feature in my app to add food `items` that we'd like to see at the potluck

4. As a `guest` to a potluck you can confirm that I'm going to the upcoming `event` ***feature coming soon***

5. As a `guest` you can select which `item`s I'd like to be responsible for bringing
